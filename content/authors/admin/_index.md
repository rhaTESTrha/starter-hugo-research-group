“Big Data” is transforming our understanding of genetic variation across chromosomes, individuals, populations, and species. My research seeks to understand these drivers of this variation using new statistical frameworks and computational algorithms for solving big questions in biology using diverse “omics”-scale data. A major goal of my work illuminating drivers of genomic novelty, innovation, and functional coevolution of quantitative traits (e.g., gene expression) in agricultural pests (e.g., herbivorous weevils). To tackle these questions, we develop efficient and effective statistical frameworks for deriving meaningful conclusions and predictions about processes that generate genomic diversity. My work seeks to build, test, and inspire new statistical frameworks & algorithms for asking big questions using “Big Data” in genomics; through this goal, we target fundamental hypotheses about drivers of quantitative trait evolution, population genomics, and functional genetics.
